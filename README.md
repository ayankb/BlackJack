## ðŸŽ® Game Overview

Blackjack is a card game where the goal is to have a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer (computer) without going over. Face cards are worth 10, and aces can be 1 or 11.

This game is played in the terminal and follows these rules:
- You and the computer are dealt two cards initially.
- You can choose to "hit" (get another card) or "stand" (end your turn).
- The dealer will keep drawing cards until they reach at least 17.
- The closest score to 21 wins!
